                    <p>I'm in love with an angel <br>
                        Heaven forbid<br>
                        Made me a believer<br>
                        With the touch of her skin<br>
                        I'd go to hell and back with you<br>
                        Stay lost in what we found<br>
                        Worlds apart we were the same<br>
                        Until we hit the ground<br>
                        <br>
                        Maybe I'm crazy<br>
                        Maybe I'm weak<br>
                        Maybe I'm blinded by<br>
                        What I see<br>
                        You wanted a soldier<br>
                        But it wasn't me<br>
                        Cuz I could never set you free<br>
                        So fly on your own<br>
                        It's time I let to you go<br>
                        <br>
                        I'm in love with an angel<br>
                        Who's afraid of the light<br>
                        Her halo is broken<br>
                        But there's fight in her eyes<br>
                        Walls are built to keep us safe<br>

                    <p>Here comes the rain again <br>
                        Falling on my head like a memory<br>
                        Falling on my head like a new emotion<br>
                        <br>
                        I want to walk in the open wind<br>
                        I want to talk like the lovers do<br>
                        I want to dive into your ocean<br>
                        Is it raining with you?<br>
                        <br>
                        Talk to me like lovers do<br>
                        Walk with me like lovers do<br>
                        Talk to me like lovers do<br>
                        Ooh, oh<br>
                        <br>
                        Here comes the rain again<br>
                        Raining in my head like a tragedy<br>
                        Tearing me apart like a new emotion<br>

                        I want to breathe in the open wind<br>
                        I want to kiss like the lovers do<br>
                        I want to dive into your ocean<br>
                        Is it raining with you?<br>
                        <br>
                        Talk to me like lovers do<br>
                        Walk with me, like lovers do<br>
